Scenario: Diagnosing Slow Network Performance
Problem: Users in your organization are experiencing slow connectivity to a remote server, and you need to identify where the delay is happening.

Steps:

Open Command Prompt:

Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
Run tracert:

Type tracert <destination IP or domain> and press Enter.
Example: tracert www.example.com
Analyze the Output:

The output will show each hop (router) the packet travels through to reach the destination.
Each hop will display the IP address or hostname and the time taken for each attempt (typically three attempts).
Interpreting Results:

Normal Latency: If the times (in milliseconds) are consistently low, the network path is performing well.
Increased Latency: If you notice a sudden spike in the times at a specific hop, it indicates a potential bottleneck.
Timeouts: If you see asterisks (*) or "Request timed out" messages, it suggests that the router is not responding to ICMP packets or is configured to drop them.

Tracing route to www.example.com [93.184.216.34]
over a maximum of 30 hops:

  6   203 ms   204 ms   203 ms  93.184.216.34

Trace complete.
Hop 1-3: Latencies are low and consistent, indicating local network performance is good.
Hop 4: A significant increase in latency occurs here, indicating a possible issue at this point or further down the path.
Hop 5-6: Similar high latency values, suggesting the problem is beyond the local network, potentially with the ISP or a specific router.
Use Cases for tracert
Identifying Network Bottlenecks: Detect where delays are occurring in the network path.
Diagnosing Connectivity Issues: Determine if a specific router or segment of the network is causing problems.
Mapping Network Paths: Understand the route taken by data packets from source to destination, useful for network planning and optimization.
Verifying ISP Performance: Check if the ISP's network is performing well or if there are issues outside the local network.
